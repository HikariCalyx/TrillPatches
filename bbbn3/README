BBN3 Poorly Documented Update Edition  

This is a Tango-exclusive update that will not be documented on the BBN3 website and will not have a proper changelog. The lack of proper documentation will be fixed... eventually.  

Update v0.0.5  
8/2/2024  

Changes:  
- Guard abilities now have their lockout tracked separately from chip lockout. Chip lockout still prevents the use of abilities, but ability lockout does not prevent the use of chips.  
- Guard abilities can be activated with B+Left in addition to Select. Both options remain available during battle.  
- By using the B+Left input, guard abilities can be used up to 5f faster than with Select. B+Left effectively ignores the last 5f worth of ability lockout.  
- Megaman gains 3f of ability lockout after moving.  
- The Select button cannot be used to buffer a guard ability while moving.  
- Shield/Reflect has a shortened ending animation (15f → 6f), this is a cosmetic change.  
- Block gains LiteArmor while active.  
- Block no longer receives a reduced lockout from blocking damage. The lockout is always 26f.  
- Shield/Reflect ability normal lockout 21f → 26f, on-block lockout 5f → 9f  
- AntiDmg ability normal lockout 40f → 45f, on-block lockout 6f → 9f  
- StepSword, StepCross, and EvilCut will no longer fail if the panel they are trying to step to is occupied. Now they can attempt to step to a closer panel, or attack without stepping at all.  
- WoodStyle CS Tornado now has the wind property when BreakCharge is installed.  
- The Meteors MegaChip causes flashing again.  
- Fixed an issue where the EX codes for Mega+5 and Giga+1 could still be used.  
- Fixed Flashman being able to pierce Mole.  
- Aura and LifeAura duration 2000f → 1600f  
- DarkAura duration 4000f → 2000f  
- AntiSword now waits to activate instead of canceling your current action. (AntiDmg already works this way)  
- AntiDmg and AntiSword will no longer prevent aura removal when activated.  


Update v0.0.4  
10/30/2023

Hotpatch 1: fixed issue with save files from this version not being recognized by Tango.  
Hotpatch 2: fixed certain attacks such as Serenade and GroundStyle Charges not cracking panels.  

Important changes:  
- The quantity and severity of permaholes has been sharply reduced.  
- Flag battles and Wind fields have been removed from Triple Battle.  
- Restock now happens only on turns 1, 4, 8, 12.  
- NorthWind no longer damages obstacles.  
- Flags do not get collision glitched by obstacles such as Prism and BlackBomb.  
- Prism has regained its vanilla HP value (infinite).  
- The expiration timers for Auras no longer count down in timefreeze.  
- Aura and LifeAura last 2K frames, DarkAura lasts 4K frames (all previously 1.6K).  
- FlashMan and PlantMan become Mega class, both lose their Guard pierce property.  
- ShockWave chip series modified, each version now changes panels differently.  
- DarkHole is affected by the obstacle limit again. This hopefully fixes a bug.  
- Several Mega & Giga chip damage buffs.  
- A few Standard chips have had changes to damage and limit.  
- Framedata buffs for v1 & v2 of Sensor, v1-v3 of LavaCannon.  
- Lava panels cause flashing again.
