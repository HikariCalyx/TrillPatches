Bingus is included in this patch.  

In Lan's room, interact with his computer to bring up the prompt that allows you to equip a ModCard.  

Detailed Confirmation Messages:  
It will display which ModCard was equipped, or it will give an error message explaining why the ModCard was not equipped. 

Supported reasons for a ModCard not being equipped:  
(Bad ID): The ID that was entered is outside the range of valid ModCard IDs.  
(Duplicate): The submitted ID is for a ModCard that is already equipped. Only 1 copy of a ModCard can be equipped.  
(Low MB): The new ModCard would cause your total MB count to exceed the limit of 80 if it were equipped, so it was not equipped. Enter the ModCard menu and remove equipped ModCards until you have enough MB available to equip the new card.  

Reminders for Tournament Rules:  
If a certain ModCard has an ability that is banned in tournaments, it will display an additional message whenever it's equipped, warning the user about the specific ability that is banned.
