<!--
In order for your patch to be accepted into the Tango patches repository, it must meet one of the following criteria:

- Non-trivial functionality: A patch that is not simply basic sprite replacements and parameter tweaks. The patch should have new functionality via novel code.
- Artistic merit: A patch with trivial functionality may be accepted on a discretionary basis. The patch should have cohesive and novel visuals or kitsch aesthetics.
- Historical significance: No new patches will be accepted under this criteria.
